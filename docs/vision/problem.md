# The Landscape

## 1. LMS platforms are frozen in time

They're slow, clunky, and built around compliance rather than engagement. Students use them because they're forced to.

## 2. Students build "shadow infrastructures"

Every class spawns a Discord server, a Notion workspace, a Drive folder.
These unofficial systems work better than the official ones, and that says everything.

## 3. Teachers lack adaptability

If a teacher wants a custom workflow, plugin, or layout, they're stuck. LMS tools aren't modular. They're cages.

## 4. Institutions lose coherence

When everything happens across random tools, nobody has a full view of learning:
materials, discussions, decisions, context… all scattered.

## 5. No system supports student agency

Students aren't passive consumers anymore. They create notes, communities, resources, but LMS platforms treat them like children.

Learning is collaborative, creative, and social. Modern platforms pretend it's a checklist.

Synapse exists to fix this mess.
