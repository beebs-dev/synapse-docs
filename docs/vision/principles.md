## 1. Flexibility over control

A system should adapt to people, not force people to adapt to it.

## 2. Student agency is a feature, not a threat

Give students the power to create, responsibly, transparently, within a shared ecosystem.

## 3. Conversation is part of learning

Chat shouldn't be an afterthought. It's the heartbeat of collaboration.

## 4. Everything is composable

Workspaces, modules, extensions. Everything should snap together cleanly.

## 5. Beautiful tools create better habits

A clean, modern UI isn't "nice to have." It affects how people think, learn, and engage.

## 6. No bloat, ever

If a feature doesn't serve real human behavior, it doesn't belong here.
