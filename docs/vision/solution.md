# The Synapse Approach

Synapse isn't trying to be a nicer Moodle.
It's redefining what a learning platform even is.

## 1. Workspaces as the core primitive

Official or student-led, both live in the same ecosystem.
Courses, groups, clubs, study circles… everything is a workspace.

## 2. Extensions, not constraints

Instead of locking users into predefined workflows, Synapse lets them add or build extensions. Think "learning apps" plugged into the platform.

## 3. Real-time social layer

Chat, notifications, presence. The same energy as Discord, baked into the system.
No more split between "where we talk" and "where we learn."

## 4. Structured academic layer

Courses, tracks, files, permissions, the stuff institutions need to function.
Clean, modern, and not surrounded by bureaucratic clutter.

## 5. API-first, integration-friendly

Synapse isn't a closed garden. Institutions can integrate their systems, automate flows, and extend the platform safely.

## The result:
A single environment where structure and freedom stop fighting.
