# **Lean Canvas**

## **1. Problem**

- Universities are stuck with clunky LMS systems (Canvas, Blackboard) that feel like 2009.
- No unified place where content, chat, AI agents, search, workspaces, and files actually work together.
- Educators have fragmented tools: LMS + Slack/Discord + Google Drive + ChatGPT + random plugins.
- Students drown in disorganized content, poor search, and noisy communication.
- Institutions can't integrate AI safely or at scale. Vendors bolt features on top of legacy systems; nothing feels native.

## **2. Customer Segments**

- **Primary:** Universities, colleges, and large learning institutions.
- **Secondary:** Online course brands, bootcamps, vocational schools.
- **Tertiary:** Government or corporate training departments.

## **3. Unique Value Proposition**

A modern, AI-native learning platform that replaces the LMS, the chat app, and the file system.
**one place where everything lives, and everything is searchable, actionable, and intelligent.**

Short version:
**"The AI-native learning OS for institutions."**

## **4. Solution**

- **Accounts & Permissions:** Clean identity + granular access across everything.
- **Courses:** Official tracks where core academic content lives.
- **Files:** Secure, versioned storage for all media.
- **Search:** Global, semantic, instant (across PDFs, videos, chat, slides).
- **Chat:** Human + AI agents with @-tagging, fully contextual.
- **Notifications:** Smart, relevance-filtered, timeline-aware.
- **Workspaces:** Flexible, student-led or institution-controlled spaces for projects, labs, or communities.
- **Extensions:** Dead-simple app layer (exam intelligence, curriculum tools, semantic timelines, etc).

## **5. Unfair Advantage**

- Nobody wants to touch this market. Startups avoid institutional software because it's slow, political, and not "cool." 
- Canvas, Blackboard, Moodle can’t rebuild an AI-native platform without blowing up their entire product.
- We get to own the official layer. Courses, files, permissions, identity, once that lives inside Synapse, a university isn't going anywhere. The lock-in is natural, not forced.
- We get to own the unofficial layer. Student workspaces replace Discord and Notion, but with direct access to actual course content. 
- Extensions turn Synapse into a full learning OS. Once that ecosystem grows, switching becomes nearly impossible.
- The adoption loop works in both directions. Students use it because it's simply better; institutions adopt it because their students already live in it.
- Tech foundation is already years ahead. Search, chat infrastructure, AI integration, are basically solved. Competitors would need years just to hit baseline.

## **6. Channels**

- Direct sales to universities (classic B2B).
- Partnerships with education ministries or large institutions.
- Pilot programs with small colleges.
- Conferences (EDUCAUSE, BETT).
- Bottom-up adoption via student-led workspaces (viral loops inside institutions).
- Influential educators on X/YouTube.

## **7. Customer Relationships**

- High-touch onboarding for institutions.
- Self-serve for smaller orgs.
- Long-term contracts (SaaS + extensions marketplace).
- Support + training for admin + faculty.
- A developer ecosystem for extensions (future).

## **8. Revenue Streams**

- Institutional subscription (per student or per seat).
- Tiered pricing: basic LMS → full OS.
- Marketplace revenue from extensions.
- On-premise / enterprise options.
- Paid AI usage pools.
- Potential premium features for student power users (like Discord Nitro)

## **9. Key Metrics**

- **Course Activation:** % of courses with real content moved into Synapse.
- **Faculty Activation:** % of instructors actively using it.
- **Search Usage:** # of searches/user/week (strongest proxy for value).
- **DAU:** Daily active students + faculty.
- **Extensions Installed:** Total + per workspace.
- **Student-Led Workspaces:** Count and growth rate (Discord replacement metric).
- **Content Import Rate:** % of official course materials pulled into student workspaces.
- **Extension Engagement:** Usage inside both official and student spaces.
- **Retention:** Same-campus retention across semesters.
- **Onboarding Speed:** Time from contract → go-live.

## **10. Cost Structure**

- Infrastructure (chat, vector search, file processing).
- Engineering + product.
- Enterprise sales & onboarding.
- Security/compliance (FERPA, GDPR).
- Support.
