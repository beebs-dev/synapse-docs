Most LMS platforms (Canvas, Blackboard, Moodle) feel like relics.

Static dashboards, ugly menus, rigid workflows.

They're built for administrators, not the people actually learning. 

Students escape to Discord and Notion because those tools feel alive. Teachers hack together their own systems because the official ones get in the way.

Synapse exists because education needs an operating system, not another portal.

A place where structured learning and free-form collaboration coexist instead of fighting each other.

The idea is simple:
- Give institutions the tools to organize and control.
- Give students the room to explore, create, and connect.
- Put everything (chat, files, courses, notes, extensions), in one shared environment.

Synapse is the bridge between how learning should feel and how it actually works today.
